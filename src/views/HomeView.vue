      YoYoing is great for everyone, no matter how young or old, even if you are a total beginner or sponsored professional. You can click the "Why Yo-Yo?" link to see a few of the top benefits from yo-yoing. No expexience is necessary to show up and throw with us. We will have some beginner throws we can loan you for you to try out yo-yoing if you've never done it. If you're a beginner we can help you increase your skills. If you're an expert, even better, come and help teach us a thing or two.

      We meet on the 2nd Saturday of every month from 1:00-4:00PM. You are free to come and go anytime between 1:00-4:00PM that works for you. Stay the whole time, stay for an hour, stay for 30 minutes or less. We would love to see you, say hi, and throw with you for however long you're available.
