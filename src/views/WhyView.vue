    <h1>Why YoYo?</h1>
    <h2>(Other than it is fun!)</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the top reasons learning to yoyo is recommended.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Improving hand-eye coordination: Yo-yoing requires a high level of coordination between the
        hands and eyes. This helps to improve overall coordination and reaction time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Promotes bilateral integration: The ability to use both sides of your body together in a
        controlled manner
      </li>
      <li>
        Expands crossing mid-line function: The ability to reach across the middle of the body with
        the arms and legs crossing over to the opposite side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improves spatial awareness: An organised awareness of the objects in the space around us,
        and also an awareness of our body's position in that space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Building strength and endurance: Yo-yoing can be physically demanding, especially when
        performing more advanced tricks. It requires the use of various muscle groups and can help
        to build strength and endurance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improving focus and concentration: Yo-yoing requires a high level of focus and concentration
        in order to perform tricks and keep the yo-yo spinning. This can help to improve overall
        focus and concentration.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reducing stress and anxiety: Yo-yoing can be a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. The
        repetitive motions and focus required can help to clear the mind and provide a sense of
        calm, and you can carry a yoyo with you almost anywhere.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enhancing creativity and problem-solving skills: Yo-yoing requires a high level of
        creativity and problem-solving skills in order to invent new tricks and combinations.
      </li>
